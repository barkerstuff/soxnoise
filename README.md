# soxnoise
A simple, interactive, ncurses noise generator.

This project is written in Python and leverages SoX for its noise generation. 
It is theoretically cross-platform, but currently is best suited for Linux and BSD.

Minimal install is needed.  The only real requirement is that SoX is installed.
A systemwide installation script that grabs dependencies for Linux installs is provided if you wish to use it.
